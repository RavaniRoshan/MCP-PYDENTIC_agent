- `ClickAction` - Click-specific parameters
- `TypeAction` - Text input parameters
- `NavigateAction` - Navigation commands

### State Models
- `BrowserState` - Current state of the browser (DOM, screenshots)
- `TaskExecutionPlan` - Step-by-step plan generated by AI
- `ActionResult` - Results of executed actions

### Response Models
- `TaskResponse` - Complete task execution response
- `ActionResponse` - Individual action results
- `ErrorResponse` - Error handling structure

## MCP Server Components

### Endpoints to Implement
