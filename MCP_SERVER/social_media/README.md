- **PostContent**: Defines the content structure for social media posts
- **ScheduledPost**: Represents a scheduled post with timing and status
- **PostResult**: Captures results of posting operations
- **SocialMediaTaskRequest**: Comprehensive request for social media tasks

### 2. Platform Controllers
- **LinkedInController**: Handles LinkedIn-specific operations
- **TwitterController**: Handles Twitter/X-specific operations
- **SocialMediaControllerInterface**: Abstract interface for all platform controllers

### 3. Main Scheduler
- **SocialMediaScheduler**: Orchestrates operations across multiple platforms
- Handles authentication, posting, and scheduling
- Integrates with the main AutomateAI agent
